Week 10
Date: 05/27/2021
Course: Python Programming(ICT-4370)

Program Description:
Week 8:
        Imports the values from the JSON file for the stocks in the portfolio and genrates line graph,
        that shows the dates on the x-axis of the graph and the closing price on y-axis.
        This code also add the imported data to the database(SQLite).
        At the end the program genrates a output.png file for ploted graph

Week 10:(from line number 147)
        In week 10 assignment I extended my assignemnt by improting data of provided stocks of one year by using Yahoo finance.
        I was also able to create .csv files for each stock and at the end I was able to create a output.json file.
        I got to know that yahoo finance is depricated in 2017 so I used yfinance library that has same functionalities.

Yahoo! finance has decommissioned their historical data API, 
causing many programs that relied on it to stop working.

fix-yahoo-finance fixes the problem by scraping the data from Yahoo! 
finance and returning a Pandas DataFrame in the same format
